# ClocksmithFX

ClocksmithFX is a simple JavaFX clock widget
made using the model-view-controller-interactor
framework by [Pragmatic Coding](https://www.pragmaticcoding.ca/).

The widget is set to always on top (so it stays in front
of most applications), is styled with CSS and 
runs using the AnimationTimer class to periodically 
get a LocalDate and LocalTime.

The motivation for this application was to create a clock
that would sit on a second screen to keep track of time 
while engrossed in games. 

This application is a work in progress.
